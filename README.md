# Cloud Computing-AWS (s349256 Ayush Maria)
 Cloud computing is the on-demand use of computer resources housed in a distant data centre and controlled by a cloud services provider, such as programs, servers (both physical and virtual), data storage, development resources, networking facilities. Through this study a distributed cloud environment was created using Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances. Matrix Multiplication and Addition of dense matrices were carried out using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the results were noted. It was observed that the solution created is cost effective but lacks the computing power to carry out Matrix Multiplication, while it efficiently handles Matrix Addition.
